I have over two years of experience in professional C++ software development, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

I am actively looking for a gameplay programmer position. Here are some of my [current portfolio projects](../games/).

In my free time, I make pixel art, play jazz piano, and go birding.

## What I Use

### Software

C++/Python on Linux and Windows.

### Games

I prefer Godot for small-scope 2D projects like game jams. I am currently learning Unreal and Unity.

### Art

Aseprite for pixel art. For design work I use Affinity Designer and Photo.

### Music

Ableton Live + MIDI keyboard.

## My Favorite Games

- Chrono Trigger
- TES IV: Oblivion and TES V: Skyrim
- Super Mario Odyssey
- Super Smash Bros. Melee
- Guilty Gear -Strive-
- Celeste
