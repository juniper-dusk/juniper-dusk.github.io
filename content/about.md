## What I Use

### Software

C++/Python/C# on both Linux and Windows.

### Games

I prefer Godot for small-scope projects like game jams, but also have used Unity in the past.

### Art

I use Aseprite for pixel art, Blender for modelling, and Affinity Designer for design work.

### Music

Just Ableton Live, my MIDI keyboard, and my piano.
