Professional C++ software developer, with over two years' experience and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

Currently looking for a gameplay programmer position. Here are some of my [current projects](../games/). In my free time I wear many hats: I make [pixel art](gallery/), play live jazz piano, and write music.
